### 🔒 Access Control Using Standard and Extended ACLs in Cisco Packet Tracer

Designed and implemented **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to regulate remote host access to network resources using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

#### ✅ Key Objectives

* Created and applied **User Access Lists (ACLs)** to **permit** or **deny** access from specific remote hosts.
* Configured and verified a **Standard ACL** to control access to a **remote server** based on **source IP address**.
* Configured and verified an **Extended ACL** to filter traffic to a remote server based on **protocols and port numbers** (e.g., **HTTP**, **FTP**).

#### 🔍 Key Highlights

* Applied ACLs on **appropriate interfaces** (inbound/outbound) for traffic control.
* Verified ACL functionality using **ping**, **web browser**, and **FTP client tests**.
* Demonstrated **secure network segmentation** and **controlled access** to sensitive services.

* Cisco Packet Tracer
* Standard & Extended ACLs
